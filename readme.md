# ASNA.Helpers.DataServices

This namespace provides classes that enable dynamic querying files on the IBM i using ASNA DataGate (it also works with MS SQL Server and the ASNA Windows DB). 

This namespace lets you define a read-only file query at runtime. The results of this query are available as either a System.Data.DataTable or Json. It works with any kind of .NET app, including Windows and ASPNET apps.
